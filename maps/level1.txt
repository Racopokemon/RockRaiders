;	The level introduction text: 
- A ... WHAT? 
- A river, sir. 
- You wanna tell me that there came ... a GODDAMN 
  RIVER out of NOWHERE? 
- Not out of nowhere, we measured the water before, 
  and when we then started to drill the walls ...
- Argh GODDAMIT. Then you maybe better drill 
  somewhere ELSE. ... However, you still see the 
  base on the other side of the river, don't you?
- yeah, I actually WAS there two minutes ago -
- SILENCE, Peter. Our scans indicate that there 
  might be a way around the river and back to the 
  base. So I suggest you just drill your way back 
  there - I mean you've just proven that you're at 
  least good at THAT -
- .. literally no idea what you're talking about ..
- AND THEEN you collect five crystals. Sounds 
  like a plan?
- yessir. ... Jesus, here we go again ..

;	The level completion text:
Hey nice, we actually found a way back to the base - 
and picked up all five crystals up there! 
  
Good work, this mine is clear now!

Just for fun, this is the not shortened text: 

- A ... WHAT? 
- A river, sir. 
- You wanna tell me that there came ... a GODDAMN RIVER out of NOWHERE? 
- Not out of nowhere, we measured the water before, and when we then started to drill the walls ...
- Couldn't you GUESS that this would happen with such instable walls? 
- Erm, no, we don't know those caves, that's why were here actually. 
- aaand for drilling ...
- sssh shut up, Peter!
- Anyway, where is the problem alltogether? Let's simply spawn a new base and ...
- GODDAMIT, NO, you MORONS! What do you think are our ressources for this project? Do you think they are unlimited or something? 
- Ressources? Can't we get anything we want from HQ anyway?
- ... not, if it's not implemented yet, to be exact ...
- PETER, keep that goddam forth wall intact *at least* for the first level!
- Intact like all the walls I'm not supposed to drill? Bruh what do you think is my JOB here? 
- Guys keep it keep it its no issue anyway ...
- Ah?
- See, how about we just drill *around* this puddle and connect us back to the base from the other side? 
- You mean, a big ark around that stream? 
- THANK YOU Mister Morne! This is EXACTLY what I expect you to do now, and you better do it QUICK, before I come down and take the drill myself! 
- pff yeah I wanna see *that* happen ..
- Peter!!
- AND THEN return back to your ACTUAL TASK! Do you remember? 
- drilling walls? ...
- COLLECTING RESSOURCES, MISTER PETER!! Are you DUMB or something?
- actually, since I realized this is only a fricking -
- 5 CRYSTALS, do you copy? 5 Crystals! There is NO returning back before you haven't gathered all of them! Understood??
- yessir. Goddamit, here we go again ..
